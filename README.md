# My_Neat
This is a version of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) made by me.  It's far from done but you can try it out using the pong sample anyway.

## Running the Pong Sample
I recommend using Linux if you are going to try to get it to work.
* Install SFML<br>`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
* Install Code::Blocks<br>`sudo apt-get install codeblocks`
* Download or clone the repository
* Navigate into the main folder of the repository
* Open My_Neat.cbp
* Compile and run in Code::Blocks
