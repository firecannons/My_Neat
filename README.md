# My_Neat
This is a version of [NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)
 made by me.  It's far from done but you can try it out using the pong sample anyway.

## The Pong Sample
The Pong Sample will evolve a networks until one achieves a perfect 10/10 game, and then shows it on the screen playing matches.
### Requirements
* A Linux distro
* [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
### How to Run It
* Install SFML<br>`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
* Install Code::Blocks<br>`sudo apt-get install codeblocks`
* Download or clone the repository
* Navigate into the main folder of the repository
* Open My_Neat.cbp
* Compile and run in Code::Blocks

## Background
NEAT is a method proposed by Ken Stanley for optimizing neural networks.  It adjusts the topology of the neural networks as well as their weights.
